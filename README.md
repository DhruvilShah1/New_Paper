The Shah's Indian Market Insights project is a dynamic and responsive web application that provides real-time insights and expert analysis on Indian markets. The website offers a clean and user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily navigate through sections such as Markets, Companies, Economy, and Global news. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a language selector for regional preferences and integrates the NewsData.io API to fetch the latest stock market news. The app is designed for seamless performance across devices, with a sticky header, interactive navigation, and a loading spinner that keeps users engaged while news data is being loaded. The project highlights my ability to build modern, data-driven web applications with a focus on usability and responsiveness.
